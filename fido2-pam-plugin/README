YubiKey FIDO2 & PAM Authentication Plugin for OpenVPN

Requirements:
- Python3
- pip packages - fido2

This plugin uses YubiKey FIDO2 and PAM to authenticate a user.

Plugin is awaiting PR acceptance for support, hopefully from OpenVPN 2.5 onwards
Pre-modified OpenVPN available from SparkLabs PPA - https://launchpad.net/~sparklabs

Viscosity does not yet support FIDO2. Support will be added when OpenVPN 2.5 is adopted.
